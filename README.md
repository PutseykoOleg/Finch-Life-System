# Initial setup
**Where can I get robot?**

This project uses the Finch robot [version 1.0](https://store.birdbraintechnologies.com/collections/featured-items/products/finch-robot).
If you are sure that this system is compatible with robots of another generation, you can purchase another version of the robot [here](https://store.birdbraintechnologies.com/).

**API**

You don't need to download API for this project, because it has already been downloaded and located in the `/libs/` and `/src/com/birdbraintechnologies/` folders. 

But if you would like to get a Finch robot API, you can download it [here](https://www.birdbraintechnologies.com/portal/finch1/program/).
